To honor my love for basketball, I plan to build a web-application that countdowns the remaining days till the start of NBA's 2015-2016 season. According to the [National Basketball Association](http://www.nba.com/news/important-dates/), the regular season begins on October 27, 2015. 

The goal is to complete this project by [Friday, September 4, 2015](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&text=Viola%20Olayinka%20Completed%20Project&dates=20150904/20150905&details=(No%20description)&location=San%20Francisco%2C&trp=false&sprop=&sprop=name:)
